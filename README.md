# AnonShare – Secure, Anonymous Data Sharing

AnonShare lets users share text, files, and notes securely without login using one-time codes. Built with privacy-first principles and optional end-to-end encryption.

## 🌟 Features

- **Anonymous Clipboard** - Share text snippets instantly with 4-digit codes
- **Rich Notepad** - Create formatted notes with rich text editor
- **Secure File Share** - Upload files up to 50MB with download limits

## 🚀 How It Works

2. **Get Short Code** - Receive a unique 4-digit code (e.g. 3453) for your content
3. **Share Code** - Give the code to anyone who needs access
4. **Instant Access** - Enter the code on our homepage to retrieve shared content
